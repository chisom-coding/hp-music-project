Potential Issues with Code:

1. Nested Callbacks: The function contains deeply nested callbacks, making it hard to read and maintain.

2. Error Handling: Errors are not consistently handled. For instance:
- If invitationResponse.status is neither 201 nor 200, it defaults to sending the response without proper checks.
- Missing error handling for shop.save().


Improvements:
1. Modern JavaScript Features:
- Used async/await for better readability.
- Destructured req for cleaner parameter handling.

2. Error Handling:
- Centralized try/catch for error management.
- Added response for unexpected statuses.

3. Reduced Callbacks: Replaced nested callbacks with async/await.

4. Code Reusability: Broke logic into smaller reusable chunks if further enhancement is needed.
